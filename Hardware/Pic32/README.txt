Some of the analog portion of RFIDler comes from a design by edude: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DIYRFIDReader#.Uz8tg1cmBaT
which is based on a schematic by Micah Dowty: http://scanlime.org/2008/08/simplest-rfid-reader


Rfidler Hardware Features:

Detection and decoding of ASK, FSK, and PSK RFID Low frequency tags ~125KHz

Emulation of ASK, FSK, and PSK RFID Low frequency tags

Sniffing of ASK, FSK, and PSK RFID Low frequency tags

Adjustment of comparator thresholds via a digital pot via software, a trim pot and a fixed value resistor voltage divider.

SD card interface

Integrated Chip Card interface

Relay driver

USB interface

Serial interface

Wiegand interfaces

User LED

User button

and an as yet untested LC (Inductance and Capacitance) meter circuit (Still in development) for testing the inductance of your own coils.




There is more to come here, but I wanted to get the schematics up as soon as I could.
