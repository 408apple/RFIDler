RFIDler LF appears to the computer as a USB serial port, and works with a standard 
Windows driver for USB serial ports, usbser.sys.

A simple driver information file rfidlercdc.inf tells Windows which driver to use, and 
such details as manufacturer (Aperture Labs Ltd) and product names (RFIDler LF).

This installer provides a simple interface to install or uninstall this file. (Note that 
complete uninstall only works on Windows XP, as Windows Vista & 7 keep a private copy.)

Alternatively to using the installer you can connect your RFIDler LF, find it in Windows 
Device Manager (via the Control Panel) and update the driver there. This program needs 
to run as local Administrator in order to copy files to, or remove files from, Windows 
protected directories.

Two versions of the installer are supplied: rfidlerinstall-x86.exe for 32-bit versions of 
Windows XP to Windows 7, and rfidlerinstall-x64.exe for 64-bit versions of Windows on x64 
CPUs.
